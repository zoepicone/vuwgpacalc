# vuwgpacalc

GPA calculator for students at Victoria University. Built using React, TypeScript, and PicoCSS. 

I made this app after spending half an hour typing in all of my courses on a different GPA calculator, and then having to restart my browser, losing all data. This app uses IndexedDB to save your GPA data locally, allowing you to return to the app at any time in the future and see your calculations.

Available here, until I get a domain name: https://vuwgpacalc.mrow.workers.dev/
